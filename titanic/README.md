# Project 8: Predicting Titanic Survival

In this project, we'll tackle the classic Titanic survival prediction problem. We'll use logistic regression to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on their features. The focus will be on feature engineering and data preprocessing, two crucial steps in real-world machine learning pipelines.
